# project 1
The project analyzes five years of student survey data from County College of Morris (CCM) computing programs (2020-2024) to identify enrollment trends, demographic patterns, and student motivations. Its purpose is to provide the CCM Information Technologies department with insights to inform strategic decisions about program offerings, recruitment, and student support initiatives. The repository contains several key components: a main Jupyter notebook (projectpart2.ipynb) that houses all analysis code; five CSV files containing the annual survey results from Fall 2020 through Fall 2024, with each containing between 197-298 student responses across 79-92 columns of demographic information, program enrollment, and student motivations; a cleaned dataset (ccm_cleaned_survey_data.csv) generated by the notebook that standardizes and combines data from all five years; and numerous visualization files in PNG format that illustrate trends in program enrollment, gender and age demographics, racial/ethnic distribution, student interest levels, computing motivations, and decision factors that influenced students to choose CCM. These visualizations include overview dashboards, program distributions, demographic breakdowns, and analysis of factors that drive student decision-making, all generated through the data processing and analysis workflows in the notebook.
