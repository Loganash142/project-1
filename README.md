# project 1
 The program analyzes five years (2020-2024) of survey data from County College of Morris (CCM) computing program students, offering comprehensive insights into enrollment trends and student demographics. It begins by importing necessary libraries and loading CSV files from each year, then implements standardization functions to normalize inconsistent responses across categories like degree programs, gender, age ranges, and ethnicity. After cleaning and combining all datasets, the program performs extensive exploratory analysis, calculating yearly statistics on enrollment numbers, program distribution, gender diversity, age demographics, and ethnic composition. The analysis includes visualizations through various charts and graphs that illustrate trends over time, such as the shift toward Computer Science becoming the most popular program and the increasing percentage of younger students. Beyond basic demographics, the program examines student motivations for seeking computing education, analyzing factors that influenced their decision to attend CCM, and their interest in taking additional computing courses. Notably, it identifies the ability to transfer credits to four-year institutions, location/convenience, and affordable cost as the top factors in students' decisions. The program concludes by saving the cleaned dataset for future use and summarizing key findings, including the observation that while overall enrollment declined from 298 students in 2020 to 197 in 2024, diversity increased and student interest in computing remained consistently high.
